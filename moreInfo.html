        <h2>Habits</h2>
        <h5><p>*Avoid eating meals or sugary snacks too close to bedtime - It disrupts sleeping patterns because it activated stomach acids</p>
    <p>*Avoid caffeine and nicotine before bed - these are stimulates that make it difficult to fall asleep until the chemicals wear off</p>
    <p>*Avoid alcohol before bedtime- once your body begins to metabolize alcohol, it goes through a period of stimulation</p>
    <p>*Avoid technology in bed- technology emits lights that suppress melatonin (hormone that controls sleep) and keeps your brain alert</p>
    <p>*Avoid a warm bedroom temperature- when you sleep, your body temperature naturally begins to decrease and having a cool room facilitates this process</p>
    <p>*Avoid odd sleeping hours- depriving yourself of sleep and having an overall inconsistent sleep schedule is harmful to your body</p>

              <p>Insufficient sleep affects growth hormone secretion that is linked to obesity. As the amount of hormone secretion decreases, the chance for weight gain increases. Blood pressure usually falls during the sleep cycle, however, interrupted sleep can adversely affect this normal decline, leading to hypertension and cardiovascular problems.</p>

              <h1><center>Fact</center></h1>
              <p>When a person misses out on a full night’s sleep many nights in a row, something called sleep debt will accumulate. Most people believe that they can catch up on missed hours of sleep during the week by sleeping in on the weekend, but, unfortunately, sleep debt simply doesn’t work this way. Although one long night of sleep may help you feel refreshed for a short while, the benefits of that additional sleep generally last only six hours or less after waking. </p>

              <p>Adults usually don’t need daytime naps if they have slept well for long enough at night. But they are useful if there has been sleep loss at night. If you do need a nap, it is best not to have one later than mid afternoon. This is so you can still get a good night’s sleep. Also, naps that last more than 15 to 20 minutes can make you feel groggy for a while after you wake up.</p>

        <p>*Decrease naps during the day.</p>
        <p>*Do not look at you clock throughout the night.</p>
        <p>*Listen to relaxing music.</p>
        <p>*Meditate/ Do yoga before bed.</p>
        <p>*Read</p>
